The goal of `bofpss3` is to make it more productive when working with the [BoF-PSS3 simulation software](https://www.suomenpankki.fi/en/financial-stability/bof-pss-simulator/), a software to simulate settlements of payment and securities transactions, developed by the Bank of Finland. This package contains wrapper functions to interact with BoF-PSS3 API.

The package is still under develoment.
